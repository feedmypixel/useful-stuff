# Useful CSS Stuff

#### Thinking modular
- Think of markup/styles as a component.
- If it feels similar to something you are already doing in CSS then donâ€™t duplicate it merge the two items together.
- If it feels like you are doing positional stuff can you use your `grid` or `layout` helpers.
- Remember a component is to be added with separate component styles. The helper `u-`, `l-` classes are for the little bits around components.
